# Local Setup

This project is not yet deployed but is available for local use as I continue to add more games, characters, etc

Uses Rails/NPM for backend and frontend

Navigate to `client` directory, run `npm install` to install dependencies, then run `npm start`

Navigate back to root and run `rails s`

Enjoy!
