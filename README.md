# FGC Combo Hub

This web app is aimed to mimic Guity Gear: Strive's combo search and upload system. A user is meant to login and search for characters under specific game titles and upload combos that are accompanied by supportive gifs that detail the inputs

Currently the only game supported right now is `Street Fighter 3: 3rd STRIKE` and it's entire 20 character roster

# Local Setup

This project is not yet deployed but is available for local use as I continue to add more games, characters, etc

Uses Rails/NPM for backend and frontend

Navigate to `client` directory, run `npm install` to install dependencies, then run `npm start`

Navigate back to root and run `rails s`

Enjoy!
